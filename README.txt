20140919, awallace: branch qce/seattle-ci/master from master
    To initialize new Jenkins config src storage for use with https://sea-alljoyn-build-b:8050, 8060, etc.
    This Jenkins config src storage intended to be shared (later) with https://build.allseenalliance.org/ci,
    and maintained in parallel thereafter via Git branches.
